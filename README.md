Astronomical Techniques II Spring 2025

# Homeworks:
HW_0 ---------------Make a line, and scatter points away from it

HW_1 ---------------Find lowest airmass object for every day in a month

HW_2 ---------------Evenly populate sphere, populate lat-long box, find area of different regions

# Week2 #

# Week4 #

Class7_notebook ------random dots evenly on a sphere, Lampert and Aitoff projections

Class8_notebook ------Separation angles, search_around_sky

# Week5 #

Class9_notebook ------break sphere into pixels, color each pixel differently, count how many dots are in each pixel.

Class10_notebook -----caps bound by RA or dec, or centered around a point with a radius of a number of degrees

# Week6 #

Class11_notebook -----Mangle files, finding overlapping regions on a sphere

Class12_notebook -----Making regions bounded by RA and Dec lines

# Week7 #

Class13_notebook ------No class

Class14_notebook ------Import packages from sub directories with __init__ files

# Week8 #

Class15_notebook ------Plot results from SQL survey, make brighter objects be bigger dots
